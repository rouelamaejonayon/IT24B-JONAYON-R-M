       <h1> Testimonial </h1>
       <p> Creating this webpage has been enjoyable as learned quite a lot while making this, such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) which is the one that structures the webpage, from it's headings, to the information put inside the webpage. HTML was one of the most important thing I learned while making this because without it I might not have made this structured webpages.</p>
       <p> The next one we learned about after HTML is CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) which basically transformed my webpage into a more stylish one that may attract certain users into using it. I learned how to style my webpage and put designs that attract users into using my page. Through learning CSS, I was able to make my webpage into a webpage that may function in different devices, may it be a laptop, iPad, or a mobile device.  </p>
       <p> While we were making this webpage I was able to learn the basic concept of HTML and CSS. I learned how to make my webpage much more livelier and more user friendly. These topics was not included in our first year so it is new to us and we were struggling to grasp the concept of HTML and CSS, but we were able to understand it with the help of our instructors. Learning HTML and CSS made us realize how important it is for our webpage.  </p>
       <p> Finally, we were able to learn the deployment processes, including web hosting and domain management, rounded out my learning. Tools like Git for version control and platforms like GitHub Pages for hosting provided practical skills essential for any web developer.</p>
