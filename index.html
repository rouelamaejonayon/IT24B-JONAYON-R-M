    </p>
    <p>Ariana Grande (real name Ariana Grande-Butera) was born and raised in Boca Raton, Fla. Her birthday is June 26, 1993, and her height is 5'2". She got her start in acting, starring in Nickelodeon sitcoms 'Victorious' (2010-2013) and 'Sam & Cat' (2013-2014). She transitioned to music in the midst of portraying Cat Valentine, launching debut album 'Yours Truly' in 2013. The set debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in September that year, with lead single "The Way" reaching No. 9 on the Hot 100. She's since earned multiple No. 1s on both tallies, with 'Thank U, Next,' 'Positions' and 'My Everything' being among several releases that topped the all-genre albums chart, while singles "Save Your Tears" and "Die for You" (both with The Weeknd), "7 Rings" and more hit the Hot 100's summit. Beyond The Weeknd, she has counted Doja Cat, Megan Thee Stallion, Nicki Minaj, Mac Miller, Justin Bieber and many others as collaborators. Her Lady Gaga team-up, "Rain on Me," won the Grammy for best pop duo/group performance in 2021; Grande also earned the best pop vocal album trophy for 'Sweetener' in 2019. She was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2018.</p>
